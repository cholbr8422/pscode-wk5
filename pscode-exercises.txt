// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers


1. INPUT variables num1, num2
2. READ values for num1, num2
3. CALCULATE SUM=num1+num2
4. OUTPUT SUM
5. STOP


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd


1. INPUT n
2. Remainder = n/2
3. IF REMAINDER is not equal to 0
4. Answer = ODD
5. ELSE
6. Answer = EVEN
7. OUTPUT answer OF ODD or EVEN
8. STOP



// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are



1. INPUT variables num1, num2, num3, num4, num5
2. READ values for num1, num2, num3, num4, num5
3. CALCULATE SUM of num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 / 5 
   AVERAGE =  (total 5 numbers/5)
4. SORT num1,num2,num3,num4,num5 in ascending order
5. The first element (num1) will be the MINIMUM number
6. The last number (num5) will be the MAXIMUM number 
7. OUTPUT AVERAGE, MINIMUM, MAXIMUM
8. STOP
